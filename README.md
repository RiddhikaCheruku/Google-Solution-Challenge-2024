# Stress Detection System with ESP32, Heart Rate Sensor, and GSR Sensor

## Overview

This project aims to create a stress detection system that monitors physiological signals such as heart rate and galvanic skin response (GSR). By combining hardware components (ESP32, heart rate sensor, and GSR sensor) with real-time stress analysis using deepface and OpenCV, we provide a holistic solution for stress relief.

## Features

- **ESP32 Integration**: The ESP32 microcontroller acts as the central processing unit, collecting data from the heart rate sensor and GSR sensor.

- **Heart Rate Monitoring**: The heart rate sensor measures the user's heart rate, providing valuable information about stress levels.

- **Galvanic Skin Response (GSR)**: The GSR sensor detects changes in skin conductivity due to emotional responses. Elevated GSR levels may indicate stress.

- **Real-Time Stress Detection**: We leverage deepface and OpenCV to analyze facial expressions and other visual cues in real time. The system detects signs of stress, such as frowning, rapid blinking, or tense facial muscles.

- **Stress Relief Suggestions**: Based on stress detection results, the system can offer personalized stress relief recommendations. These may include breathing exercises, guided meditation, or soothing music.

## Hardware Setup

1. **ESP32 Configuration**:
   - Connect the ESP32 to the heart rate sensor and GSR sensor.
   - Ensure proper power supply and communication interfaces (I2C, UART, etc.).

2. **Heart Rate Sensor**:
   - Attach the heart rate sensor (e.g., MAX30102) to the user's fingertip or earlobe.
   - Read heart rate data using the ESP32's analog or digital pins.

3. **GSR Sensor**:
   - Place the GSR electrodes on the user's skin (typically on the fingers).
   - Measure skin conductance variations using the ESP32's analog pins.

## Software Implementation

1. **Data Acquisition**:
   - Read heart rate and GSR data from the sensors.
   - Sample at regular intervals (e.g., every second).

2. **Real-Time Stress Detection**:
   - Capture video frames using the ESP32 camera (if available).
   - Apply deepface models to analyze facial expressions.
   - Use OpenCV for additional stress cues (e.g., eye movement, facial muscle tension).

3. **Stress Thresholds**:
   - Define stress thresholds based on heart rate and GSR values.
   - Combine physiological data with visual cues for accurate stress assessment.

4. **Stress Relief Recommendations**:
   - If stress levels exceed thresholds, provide personalized recommendations.
   - Display messages on an OLED display or send notifications to a mobile app.

## Usage

1. **Compile and Upload**:
   - Compile the code using the ESP-IDF framework.
   - Upload the firmware to the ESP32.

2. **Monitor Data**:
   - View heart rate and GSR data on the serial monitor.
   - Observe real-time stress detection results.

3. **Interact with Stress Relief Suggestions**:
   - Follow the system's recommendations for stress relief activities.
